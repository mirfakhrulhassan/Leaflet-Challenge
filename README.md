Summary: United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment; and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes.The goal of this project is to create a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from their data set (geoJson) based on their longitude and latitude.

Data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake in their size and color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger and darker in color.Popups provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.Legends provide context for map data.

A second data set on the map has been added related to tectonic plates to illustrate the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity.A number of base maps to choose from as well as separated out two different data sets into overlays that can be turned on and off independently with layer controls.
